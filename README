Overview
========

The Network Viewer is an interactive viewer and explorer for networks of
nodes. The Network Viewer is based on the Vrui software development
toolkit (see http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/Vrui), and runs in
a variety of environments ranging from laptop or desktop computers over
semi-immersive environments such as Geowalls to fully immersive virtual
reality environments such as CAVEs.

Requirements
============

The Network Viewer requires Vrui version 10.2 build 001 or newer, and the
Vrui Collaboration Infrastructure version 9.0 or newer.

Installation Guide
==================

It is recommended to download or move the source packages for Vrui and
the Network Viewer into a src directory underneath the user's home
directory. Otherwise, references to ~/src in the following instructions
need to be changed.

0.1. Install Vrui from ~/src/Vrui-<version>-<build> (see Vrui README file).
0.2. Install the Vrui Collaboration Infrastructure from
     ~/src/CollaborationInfrastructure-<version> (see Vrui Collaboration
     Infrastructure README file).

1. Change into ~/src directory and unpack the Network Viewer tarball:
   > cd ~/src
   > tar xfz <download path>/NetworkViewer-<version>.tar.gz
   - or -
   > tar xf <download path>/NetworkViewer-<version>.tar

2. Change into the Network Viewer base directory:
   > cd NetworkViewer-<version>

3. If the Vrui version installed in step 0 was not 10.2, or Vrui's
   installation directory was changed from the default of /usr/local,
   adapt the makefile using a text editor. Change the value of
   VRUI_MAKEDIR close to the beginning of the file as follows:
   VRUI_MAKEDIR := <Vrui install dir>/share/make
   Where <Vrui install dir> is the installation directory chosen in
   step 0. Use $(HOME) to refer to the user's home directory instead
   of ~.

4. Adapt makefile if the Network Viewer is to be installed in a
   different location than the default of /usr/local. Set INSTALLDIR to
   the desired target location. The Network Viewer will then be
   installed in <INSTALLDIR>/bin and <INSTALLDIR/share (where
   <INSTALLDIR> is the value of INSTALLDIR set in the makefile).

5. Build the Network Viewer:
   > make
   This creates the Network Viewer executables in ./bin.

6. Install the Network Viewer in the selected target location:
   > make install
   - or, if the target location is a system directory -
   > sudo make install
   This will copy all executables into <INSTALLDIR>/bin and all
   resources into <INSTALLDIR>/share.

7. Optional: Add directory containing the Network Viewer executables (in
   <INSTALLDIR>/bin) to the user's search path. This allows running the
   Network Viewer from any directory. Using csh or tcsh:
   > setenv PATH ${PATH}:<INSTALLDIR>/bin
   where <INSTALLDIR> is the target location set in the makefile.
   Using bash:
   > export PATH=${PATH}:<INSTALLDIR>/bin
   These lines can also be added to the user's .cshrc or .bashrc files
   to make the additions persist between logins.

Running the Network Viewer
=========================

These instructions assume that the Network Viewer was installed in its
base directory, (see steps 4 and 6 above).

1. On MacOS X: Start X11. The Network Viewer requires a running X
   server, but, if preferred, it can be started from a MacOS X terminal
   instead of xterm.

2. See Vrui's HTML documentation on Vrui's basic user interface and how
   to use the Network Viewer.
