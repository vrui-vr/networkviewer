NetworkViewer-1.9:
- Fixed mismatching boundary problem in ParticleOctree class when
  dynamically growing octree, by explicitly storing each node's center
  point.
- Implemented symmetric distance constraint relaxation algorithm that
  does not cause overall translations or rotations.
- Added distConstraintScale to class ParticleSystem to modulate the
  overall strength of distance constraint relaxation.
- Use link object's value field to set a distance constraint strength in
  class Network.
- Removed linkStrength element from class NetworkSimulator; use new
  ParticleSystem::distConstraintScale element.
- Added missing callback for SelectNodeNotification message in
  NetworkViewerClient.
- Fixed wrong vertex count when rendering links in NetworkViewerClient.
- Parallelized particle simulation and network layout.

NetworkViewer-2.0:
- Changed baseFile parameter in JsonFile constructor from autopointer to
  reference.
- Changed networkFile parameter in Network constructor from autopointer
  to reference.
  - Adapted NetworkViewer application class.
- Changed from Misc::FunctionCall to Threads::FunctionCall in
  NetworkSimulator class and changed callback parameter to reference.
- Changed protocol to use Metadosis to stream network files.
  - Many concomitant changes.
- Renamed collaborative network viewer application to
  CollaborativeNetworkViewer.

NetworkViewer-3.0:
- Removed a lot of debugging/timing code.

    application.
- Put serialization code directly into SimulationParameters and
  RenderingParameters structs.
  - Removed serialization code from NetworkViewerProtocol.
- Set minimum link line width to 0.5 to avoid GL errors.
- Replaced a lot of UI code with widget variable tracking.
- Moved simulation parameters out of NetworkViewerClient and into main
  application.
